# Stream Processing - Containerized Microservices with Docker
This project implements a large-scale and data-intensive application for real-time stream processing. The streaming pipeline consists of Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Telegraf, and Grafana. With the use of Docker, the solution stack is assembled with isolated microservices orchestrated by docker-compose. The implementation ensures reliability, scalability, and maintainability as well as data security, governance, and protection. As an example use case, a Twitter dataset about the 2020 United States presidential election is processed and visualized in a dashboard for analysis.
